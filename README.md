_A collection of sketches made for the course "Processing for designers"_


__LUNGS__

The sketch displays a pair of lungs that inflate and deflate
You can make the subject start running and the lungs will breathe faster and faster
When the person is running there will be a text display saying "YASSS EXERCISE!!"
The code uses the library controlp5, classes, arrays, and loops
Not much to look at but I tried to apply all my knowledge
